# Breach-Response-Case-Studies
Summary
Analyzed the 2017 Equifax ransomware breach using MITRE ATT&CK and CVE reports; identified root vulnerabilities, response gaps, and proposed security improvements to prevent future incidents.

Solution
 The project achieved its goals by identifying key vulnerabilities like unpatched software and poor segmentation, then providing actionable solutions: regular patching, network hardening, employee training, and incident response planning ultimately helping reduce future breach risk and enhance organizational resilience.  



Approach
 

Selected the Equifax breach as a case study. Researched the attack timeline and technical root cause (CVE-2017-5638). Analyzed security failures using MITRE ATT&CK. Assessed business impact and costs. Used a structured reporting template to recommend cybersecurity controls and response improvements. Presented findings using a professional PowerPoint format.
